# DDE INJECTION

What is DDE
------------
The DDE protocol is a set of messages and guidelines that allows applications to exchange or share data within operating systems. DDE sends messages between applications that share data and uses shared memory to exchange data between applications.
The motive of an attacker is to abuse this functionality of DDE to execute arbitrary commands. Once this is successfully achieved the attacker can take control of the victim system and make it work as per his own usage.
